# SkinCare
People use skincare products to take care of their faces, but using inappropriate ones may lead to facial issues such as allergies and inflammation. Our team has developed a system called "SKINCARE," which uses a smartphone camera to detect skin conditions. This system includes four common facial symptom assessments for wrinkles, spots, redness, and acne. It accurately identifies skin conditions and provides feedback and recommendations, allowing users to monitor their skin health. Based on the user's skin condition, suitable skincare products are suggested to prevent and improve facial issues.
